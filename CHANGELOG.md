# STUDIO PLUS API CHANGELOG

## v2.0.0 (15th Mar 2023)
- Added 4 Texture Pack Methods, basically improved version of the 'Basic texture pack system' found on the ppg modding website (https://www.studiominus.nl/ppg-modding/snippets/texturePackSystem.html), you may call this the'Advanced texture pack system`
- Removed StudioPlusAPI.SpawnGameObject because it seems to be completely useless
- ArmorWearer now contains a variable that stores the armor game object that essentially allows you to modify an armor piece when it's put on an entity
- Restructured the entire API: 
    - Now you have to add 'using StudioPlusAPI' to each file
    - There are now multiple different sub-APIs: ChemistryPlus, TexturePlus, CreationPlus, PlusAPI (Misc.)

## v1.1.2 (15th Dec 2022)
- Made buttons of ArmorBehaviour consistent with vanilla buttons, I hate small inconsistencies.
