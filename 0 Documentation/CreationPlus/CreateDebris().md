# StudioPlusAPI
## CreationPlus (REQUIRES PlusAPI)
### CreateDebris()
Creates a custom debris object.<br/>
```cs
public static GameObject CreateDebris(string name, Transform parent, Sprite sprite, Vector2 position)
```
This is a very specific method that was only added in here for convinience to use for another mod I made, so this might be completely useless outside of that very specific context, and that context also involes a class that is not contained in StudioPlusAPI.
