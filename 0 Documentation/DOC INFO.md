# DOCUMENTATION

This is the official documentation for StudioPlusAPI!<br/>
In here I will go over every single thing in this API. Each folder represents a file, and every .md file in said folder usually represents a method or a class, occasionally a specific string or something like that.

There is also a summarized version of the documentation in here for convinience of one file.
