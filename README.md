# Studio-Plus-API
## Current Version: v2.0.0
This is an API for mods created by Studio Plus, open source because stuff like this should be open source.

Code snippets will be added in for all of the stuff within the API but this was created in a semi-rush to upload the files of ArmorBehaviour+ so I still have to add that in.

It should be noted that there are 2 types of snippets I'll add in: [MOD] and [SNIPPET]:
- [MOD] is an actual mod that you can throw into your mods folder
- [SNIPPET] is either a file or group of files that would not work as a mod on their own without you doing something to make it work.

### How do I use it?
- Put the file in your mod folder and add it to the list in mod.json
- Add 'using StudioPlusAPI;' at the start of each file.
- There are a few sub-APIs within the API itself: ChemistryPlus, TextruePlus, CreationPlus and PlusAPI (misc stuff). Use them accordingly as shown in examples.
