# Studio-Plus-API
## Current Version: v1.1.0
This is an API for mods created by Studio Plus, open source because stuff like this should be open source.

Code snippets will be added in for all of the stuff within the API but this was created in a semi-rush to upload the files of ArmorBehaviour+ so I still have to add that in.

It should be noted that there are 2 types of snippets I'll add in: [MOD] and [SNIPPET]:
- [MOD] is an actual mod that you can throw into your mods folder
- [SNIPPET] is either a file or group of files that would not work as a mod on their own without you doing something to make it work.
